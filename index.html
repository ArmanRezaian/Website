      <p><h1>Hello, my name is Arman. This is my portfolio website.</h1>
        I graduated from FSU with a BS in Economics in December of 2021. I have been a customer support technician with the AppleCare team and I am currently the manager of WVFS Tallahassee's music studio. I'm currently searching for entry-level work in software-engineering and data science. I'm especially interested in algorithmic trading and video game development.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>As part of my data science certification, I completed an analysis of the Boston housing market as well as exploratory data analysis on financial markets by webscraping stock price information. These projects can be accessed as Jupyter notebooks with the buttons below.</p>

      <p>Recently I took part in a "Game-Jam" with friends where we developed a video game over the course of the week.</p>

      <p>I'm currently developing a VST plug-in for audio software in C++ using the JUCE library.</p>
      <p>I am also currently building a neural network using Python and Tensorflow to predict asset prices in financial markets. </p>
